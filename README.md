# JavaScript Projects Collection

A collection of all my JavaScript projects — built while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📁 What's Inside

This repository contains multiple folders, each for a different project. Some are simple, some are more complex — but all of them are built with vanilla JavaScript along with HTML and CSS.

### Examples of Projects

- 🎮 Mini Games (e.g., Tic Tac Toe, Rock Paper Scissors)
- 🧮 Calculators
- 🛠️ Self-Made Creative Projects
- 💡 Small projects from learning and experimenting
