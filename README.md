# JavaScript Projects Collection

A collection of all my JavaScript projects — built while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📁 What's Inside

This repository contains folders for different small projects I made while learning and practicing. All of them are built with vanilla JavaScript.

### Examples of Projects

- 🎮 Mini Games (e.g., Tic Tac Toe, Rock Paper Scissors)
- 🧮 Calculators
- 🛠️ Self-Made Creative Projects
- 💡 Small projects from learning and experimenting

> **Note:** These are not my main projects — those are available on CodePen.
