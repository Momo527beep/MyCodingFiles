# JavaScript Projects Collection

A collection of small JavaScript projects I made while learning and practicing HTML, CSS, and JS.

## 📁 What's Inside

This repository contains folders with very simple, self-made projects — all built using vanilla JavaScript.


**Note:** These are not my main projects — those are available on CodePen.
